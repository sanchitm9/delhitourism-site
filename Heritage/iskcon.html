            <p>In contrast to the chaos of central Delhi, the quaint Hailey Road hides a gem which has become a
                tourist hotspot in Delhi, the infamous Agrasen Ki Baoli. Made famous by iconic movies like PK and
                Sultan, Agrasen ki Baoli has become the new trend in the city. Amidst the jungle of concrete, this
                quaint little monument in Delhi is a reminiscence of the heritage of medieval times. One of the most
                preserved monuments in Delhi, Agrasen ki Baoli is a monument of many origins and history. Believed
                to be one of the most haunted monuments in Delhi, the water in Baoli was believed to be a source of
                Black magic. It was believed that who so ever looked at the black water of the Baoli used to commit
                suicide by jumping from the top of the Baoli. However, just like any folklore, there has been no
                actual proof of it. Today, the monument is flocked by visitors and birds, who have called it their
                home. 108 steps well, as you descend to its lower level, the cold air makes the surrounding more
                gothic. In a situation like that, you might actually start believing the tales of haunted. Although
                there is no water left inside the stepwell, you might still wonder how glorious it would look,
                filled with water
